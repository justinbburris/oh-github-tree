# O Github Tree

O Github Tree! O Github Tree!

Thy nodes are so unchanging;

O Github Tree! O Github Tree!

Thy nodes are so unchanging;

Not only public when Stalmans near,

But also when the trolls will sneer.

O Github Tree! O Github Tree!

Thy nodes are so unchanging!

O Github Tree! O Github Tree!

Much pleasure thou can'st give me;

O Github Tree! O Github Tree!

Much pleasure thou can'st give me;

How often has the Github tree

Afforded me the greatest glee!

O Github Tree! O Github Tree!

Much pleasure thou can'st give me.

O Github Tree! O Github Tree!

Thy repos grow so quickly!

O Github Tree! O Github Tree!

Thy repos grow so quickly!

From pull request, to merge conflict,

Resolving each one with a click.

O Github Tree! O Github Tree!

Thy repos grow so quickly!

O Github Tree! O Github Tree!

How lovely are your branches!

O Github Tree! O Github Tree!

How lovely are your branches!

Thou bidst open and transparent be,

And trust in freedom infinitely.

O Github Tree! O Github Tree!

How lovely are your branches!
